The format of the MongoDB _id field is a 12-byte binary value, typically represented as a 24-character hexadecimal string. The format of the _id field is important and should not be modified because it is used as a primary key in MongoDB, and changing its format could lead to unexpected behavior in your database.

The _id field in MongoDB is guaranteed to be unique within a collection. It includes a timestamp component that ensures that the _id values are monotonically increasing, which helps to optimize queries and indexing. The _id field is also randomly generated and includes a unique machine identifier and a counter to ensure uniqueness across multiple machines.

Therefore, you cannot modify the format of the _id field in MongoDB without potentially causing issues in your database. However, you can use a custom identifier field in addition to the _id field if you need to track your documents using another identifier format.
